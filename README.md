MERN Stack CRUD App
This is a MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) stack CRUD application that allows you to manage users. The application consists of a backend API built with Express.js and a frontend UI built with React.js.

Getting Started
Prerequisites
Before running the application, make sure you have the following software installed on your machine:

Node.js (https://nodejs.org/)
MongoDB (https://www.mongodb.com/)
Installation
Clone the repository to your local machine.
Navigate to the project directory:
//run code on cmd:cd my-mern-app

install backend dependencies:
//run code on cmd:npm install

Navigate to the frontend directory and install frontend dependencies:
//run code on cmd:cd src
//npm install

Configuration
Backend Configuration:

Create a .env file in the root of the backend folder.
Add your MongoDB connection URI to the .env file:
//code:MONGODB_URI=YOUR_MONGODB_CONNECTION_URI

Replace YOUR_MONGODB_CONNECTION_URI with your actual MongoDB connection string.

Running the Application
Start the backend server:
//code :npm run start
//code:cd src
//code:npm start

The application should now be running. Access the frontend UI in your browser at http://localhost:3000.
Backend API Endpoints
GET /users: Get all users.
POST /users: Create a new user.
Frontend Features
Display a list of users retrieved from the backend API.
Implement a form to create a new user and send the data to the backend API.
Allow updating and deleting users from the frontend interface.

Additional Features (Optional)
The following additional features have been implemented in the application:

User authentication using JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for securing the API endpoints.
Pagination and sorting functionality on the user listing page.
Search functionality to filter users based on specific criteria.

Make sure to replace YOUR_MONGODB_CONNECTION_URI with your actual MongoDB connection string in the .env file.
